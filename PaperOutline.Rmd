Power Under Multiplicity Project (PUMP): An R package for estimating statistical power, minimum detectable effect sizes (MDES's) and sample sizes when adjusting for multiple hypothesis tests
Draft outline

# Introduction
* Available software for estimating statistical power, MDES and sample sizes for RCT's in education research
- world of modest number of outcomes (relative to some science applications)
* Brief summary of the multiple testing problem
* Common MTPs in education research and their impact on power, MDES's and sample sizes
* Important contributions of the PUMP package

# Estimating Power, MDES's and Sample Sizes in Studies of Impacts on Multiple Outcomes 
* Approach for estimating statistical power
  + General strategy
  + Specifications for each RCT design (in appendix)
* Approach for estimating MDES's and sample size
* Modeling empirical findings for faster estimation
* Validation (how much/what should we present?)
  + paragraph on what we did 
  + consider options for making code available

# Software
* Map of PUMP functions (functions/naming convention for each design)
* Inputs 
* Outputs
 + for shiny, we will create plots - better to make them part of the package?
* To what extent should we cover Shiny app in the paper? 

# Example(s)
* maybe one blocked individual RCT and one cluster RCT?
* maybe one is scenario for designing study and one is scenario for post-hoc power analysis?
 + post hoc might be best place to start since simplest
 + then more about design considerations after making software clear

# Guidance for practice (or after software section below?)
* Considerations for study design - limted to implications from multiple testting plus short lit review of key issues related to design issues 
* Considerations for specifying assumptions (or do we go through this when discussing inputs for R functions)
  + how to come up with correlation assumption
  + importance of looking at ranges when it matters a lot

# Conclusion and Next Steps
