# Manuscript

- explanation of min power when numZero > 0 (KP, shiny)

*Waiting*

- prepare formatting for submission (KH)
- move vignette into package (KH or LM)

# Package updates

- write simulation correlation tool (KH)

# Validation

- WY validation finish run and writeup (KH in progress)
  
# Stretch goals

- messaging (KH or LM)
  - collect errors from grid and only print out unique errors
  - give user estimate of runtime for WY for MDES and SS
- vary multiple factors in plots (LM)
- surface WY functions to user with good documentation (KH)
- tool that helps user build a block matrix of correlations based on a list of correlations between outcomes (KH)
- generate a data frame of reasonable defaults for shiny that produce 80% power
- additional designs: d2.2_m2rr, d3.3_m2ff, d3.1_m3fc2rr, d2.2_m2cc with cluster robust standard errors
- effect size calculator
- speed up everything
- binary outcomes
- discussion of Benjamini-Hochberg
