# R package

- Silence ROxygen documentation for non-exported functions (Zarni?)

# Manuscript

- look into journal submission process (KH)
- check if JSS allows vignette to be published separately (KH)
- cover letter (LM) 
- add plots to vignette (LM)
- write abstract (KH or KP)
- prepare formatting for submission (KH)
- explanation of min power when numZero > 0 (KP)

*Waiting*

- add appendices to main document (waiting on validation to finish KH)
- once manuscript is ready, move vignette into package (KH or LM)

# Package updates

*High priority*

- send user test "homework" assignment to Luke (KH)
- recruit people for user testing of package (KH/LM)
- add flag to not drop any outcomes (KH)
- fix MDES code for zero MDES (LM)

*Medium priority*

- write simulation correlation tool (KH)

*Low priority*

- plotting code (LM)
  - clean up and condense data wrangling
  - make plots prettier
- error/other messaging (KH or LM)
  - tell user that mdes and sample size single scenario plots don't make sense (KH)
  - collect errors from grid and only print out unique errors
  - better error messaging for flat power curves (both shiny and non-shiny)
  - error if user passes same parameter in twice into grid
  - give user estimate of runtime for WY (MDES and SS will require extra work)
- small things
  - make sure user can't pass in vector of numCovar (KH)

# Validation

- re-run non-WY validation with sided tests fixed (KH)
- re-run WY validation (KH)
- render validation documents (KH)
- incorporate into appendix (KH)
  
# Waiting

- merge change from design to d_m, new MTP names

# Stretch goals

- vary multiple factors in plots (LM)
- surface WY functions to user with good documentation (KH)
- tool that helps user build a block matrix of correlations based on a list of correlations between outcomes (KH)
- generate a data frame of reasonable defaults for shiny that produce 80% power
- additional designs: d2.2_m2rr, d3.3_2mff, d3.1_m3fc2rr, d2.2_m2cc with cluster robust standard errors
- effect size calculator
- speed up everything
- binary outcomes
- discussion of Benjamini-Hochberg

# Shiny app
- in separate document

# Video
- review script
