   abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetic fields (ERFs) are typically analyzed via ANOVAs on mean activity in a priori windows. Advances in computing power and statistics have produced an alternative, mass univariate analyses consisting of thousands of statistical tests and powerful corrections for multiple comparisons. Such analyses are most useful when one has little a priori knowledge of effect locations or latencies, and for delineating effect boundaries. Mass univariate analyses complement and, at times, obviate traditional analyses. Here we review this approach as applied to ERP/ERF data and four methods for multiple comparison correction: strong control of the familywise error rate (FWER) via permutation tests, weak control of FWER via cluster-based permutation tests, false discovery rate control, and control of the generalized FWER. We end with recommendations for their use and introduce free MATLAB software for their implementation.},

   abstract = {This paper provides a guide to calculating statistical power for the complex multilevel designs that are used in most field studies in education research. For multilevel evaluation studies in the field of education, it is important to account for the impact of clustering on the standard errors of estimates of treatment effects. Using ideas from survey research, the paper explains how sample design induces random variation in the quantities observed in a randomized experiment, and how this random variation relates to statistical power. The manner in which statistical power depends upon the values of intraclass correlations, sample sizes at the various levels, the standardized average treatment effect (effect size), the multiple correlation between covariates and the outcome at different levels, and the heterogeneity of treatment effects across sampling units is illustrated. Both hierarchical and randomized block designs are considered. The paper demonstrates that statistical power in complex designs involving clustered sampling can be computed simply from standard power tables using the idea of operational effect sizes: effect sizes multiplied by a design effect that depends on features of the complex experimental design. These concepts are applied to provide methods for computing power for each of the research designs most frequently used in education research. Appendices include: (1) Design Effects in Two- or Three-Level Hierarchical Designs With and Without Covariates; (2) Design Effects in Two- or Three-Level Randomized-Block Designs With and Without Covariates; (3) Computing Power in Three-Level Randomized-Block Designs; (4) Multilevel Models Defining Tests for Treatment Effects; and (5) Glossary of Terms.

   abstract = {This paper examines issues related to the statistical power of impact estimates for experimental evaluations of education programs. The focus is on "group-based" experimental designs, because many studies of education programs involve random assignment at the group level (for example, at the school or classroom level) rather than at the student level. The clustering of students within groups (units) generates design effects that considerably reduce the precision of the impact estimates, because the outcomes of students within the same schools or classrooms tend to be correlated (that is, are not independent of each other). This, statistical power is a concern for these evaluations. The report is organized into five sections. First, it discusses general issues for a statistical power analysis, including procedures for assessing appropriate precision levels. Second, it discusses reasons that a clustered design reduces the statistical power of impact estimates and provides a simple mathematical formulation of the problem. Third, it presents procedures that can be used to reduce design effects. Fourth, it provides power calculations for impact estimates under various design options and parameter assumptions, and finally, it presents conclusions. Appended is: Values for Factor (.) in Equation (2). (Contains 8 tables.) [This report was submitted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. to the Institute of Education Sciences.]},

   abstract = {Studies that examine the impacts of education interventions on key student, teacher, and school outcomes typically collect data on large samples and on many outcomes. In analyzing these data, researchers typically conduct multiple hypothesis tests to address key impact evaluation questions. Tests are conducted to assess intervention effects for multiple outcomes, for multiple subgroups of schools or individuals, and sometimes across multiple treatment alternatives. Multiple comparisons issues are not frequently addressed in impact evaluations of educational interventions. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) at the U.S. Department of Education (ED) contracted with Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) to develop guidelines for appropriately handling multiple testing in education research. This report provides a structure to address the multiplicity problem and discusses issues to consider when formulating a testing strategy. Four appendixes are included: (1) Panel Members; (2) Introduction to Multiple Testing; (3) Weighting Options for Constructing Composite Domain Outcomes; and (4) Bayesian Hypothesis Testing Framework (alternative to the classical hypothesis testing framework that is assumed for this report.)
