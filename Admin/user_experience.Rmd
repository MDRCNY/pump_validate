# To Do List

- Fix code so that it works for M=1. In that case, just return raw p-values
- Return a vector of power for all individual outcomes rather than the average, fix downstream effects of this.
- If we have zero/null effects, warn user that min2 and complete power will be low, and possibly don't return those values.
- Fix for when power = 0 case for MDES and sample size
- clarify that right now maxT and minP are the SAME method.
- Tell user that ICC only makes sense for random effects models.
- For simulations, interval bars are based on normal approximation to binomial, with conservative standard error S/0.25

# UI notes

- Update: User is forced to input a ATE_ES vector of length M. So if you are interested in testing some zero effects, input c(0.125, 0, 0)
