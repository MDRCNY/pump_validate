- vary multiple factors in plots
- plot behavior for grid objects
- surface WY functions to user with good documentation
- tool that helps user build a block matrix of correlations based on a list of correlations between outcomes
- generate a data frame of reasonable defaults for shiny that produce 80% power
- additional designs: d2.2_m2rr, d3.3_m2ff, d3.1_m3fc2rr, d2.2_m2cc with cluster robust standard errors
- effect size calculator
- speed up everything
- binary outcomes
